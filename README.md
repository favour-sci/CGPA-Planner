## Student Grade Planner Pro

The Student Grade Planner Pro is a powerful, interactive, and privacy-focused dashboard designed to help students track, predict, and visualize their academic performance. It allows users to input test and exam scores to forecast their GPA/CGPA dynamically. Features include automatic data visualization, grade scale toggling (4.0/5.0), and data integration. Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, utilizing **Chart.js** for real-time analytics.

The **Student Grade Planner Pro** solves the problem of manual CGPA calculation and lack of academic visualization. It moves beyond simple spreadsheets by providing a "What-If" analysis tool—allowing students to "paint their scenario" by inputting potential scores to see how they impact their final standing.

Because it runs entirely in the browser using **Local Storage**, student data remains private on their device and persists between sessions.
